# SecureEstimation
These python notebooks intend to implement the decoder proposed by Fawzi et al. in the paper:

Fawzi, Hamza, Paulo Tabuada, and Suhas Diggavi. "Secure estimation and control for cyber-physical systems under adversarial attacks." IEEE Transactions on Automatic control 59.6 (2014): 1454-1467.

Neglecting\ Feedback\ Control.ipynb aims to implement the decoder for the problem statement formulated by equation (2) of the paper

ControlProblemWithOutputFeedback.ipynb aims to implements the decoder for the problem statement formulated by equation(15) of the paper

The two .npy files are the outputs of the second python notebook
